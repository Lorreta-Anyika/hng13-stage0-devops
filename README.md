## Steps I Took

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ GitHub Setup
- Forked the official `hng13-stage0-devops` repository.  
- Added a `README.md` file containing project and personal details.  
- Documented my deployment process clearly for verification.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Cloud Server Deployment
- Set up a **free-tier AWS EC2 instance** running Ubuntu.  
- Configured SSH access using an RSA key pair for secure login.  
- Updated and upgraded the server using `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Web Server Configuration
- Installed and started **NGINX** to handle HTTP web requests.  
- Verified the default server page to confirm successful setup.  
- Edited the file `/var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html` to include:
  - My name and Slack username  
  - Platform name (AWS EC2)
  - Deployment date  
- Reloaded NGINX and tested accessibility on port 80.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Verification
- Accessed the webpage publicly using:  
  üëâ **http://13.60.92.199//**  
- Confirmed server uptime, accessibility, and correct content display.
